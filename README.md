# The Project
The objective was to  use supervised learning algorithms to classify
and analyse sketch data from Google's Quick, Draw! data set.
For the project k-nearest neighbour and neural network classifiers
were implemented from scratch for a recognition task
involving a custom subset (5 category .npy file) using the
open source dataset available [here](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).
